# Cyrillic Transliteration using RNN

This project is designed to transliterate Latin-based Cyrillic text to correct Cyrillic text using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The script reads input data from a `.svc` file and trains a model to perform the transliteration.

## Requirements

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## RUN

```bash
python3 rnn.py
```
